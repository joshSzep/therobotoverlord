# Testing `UserEvent` Model and Methods

This checklist outlines the tasks needed to achieve 100% test coverage for the `UserEvent` model and its logging methods in `backend/src/backend/db/models/user_event.py`. The current test coverage for this file is 81%.

## Test Setup

- [x] Create a test file at `backend/tests/db/models/test_user_event.py`.
- [x] Set up necessary test fixtures:
  - [x] Fixture for a sample `user_id` (e.g., `uuid.uuid4()`).
  - [x] Fixture for sample `ip_address` (e.g., "127.0.0.1").
  - [x] Fixture for sample `user_agent` (e.g., "TestClient/0.1").

## Testing `UserEvent` Class Methods

For each `log_*` method, ensure the following:
- The method is an `async` class method.
- It calls `UserEvent.create` with the expected arguments.
- The returned `UserEvent` instance (or the arguments passed to `create`) has the correct `event_type`, `user_id`, `ip_address`, and `user_agent`.

- [x] **Test `log_login_success`**
  - [x] Verify `UserEvent.create` is called with `event_type="login_success"` and correct user/client info.

- [x] **Test `log_login_failure`**
  - [x] Test with a valid `user_id`:
    - [x] Verify `UserEvent.create` is called with `event_type="login_failure"` and correct user/client info.
  - [x] Test with `user_id=None`:
    - [x] Verify `UserEvent.create` is called with `event_type="login_failure"`, `user_id=None`, and correct client info.

- [x] **Test `log_logout`**
  - [x] Verify `UserEvent.create` is called with `event_type="logout"` and correct user/client info.

- [x] **Test `log_password_change`**
  - [x] Verify `UserEvent.create` is called with `event_type="password_change"` and correct user/client info.

- [x] **Test `log_account_lockout`**
  - [x] Verify `UserEvent.create` is called with `event_type="account_lockout"` and correct user/client info.

## Testing Model Fields (Basic Instantiation)

- [x] Test basic instantiation of `UserEvent` with all fields, including optional ones like `resource_type`, `resource_id`, and `metadata` to ensure model definition is sound (though the `log_*` methods don't use these directly).
  - [x] Created a separate test that directly calls `UserEvent.create` with all fields.

## Mock Strategy

- [x] Mock `backend.db.models.user_event.UserEvent.create`:
  - [x] Used `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `UserEvent.create`.
  - [x] Set up assertions to verify that `create` was called with the correct arguments by each `log_*` method.
  - [x] Configured the mock to return a `MagicMock` instance.

## Test Coverage Goals

- [x] Achieve 100% line coverage for `user_event.py`.
- [x] Ensure all parameters and branches within the `log_*` methods are tested (especially the `user_id: uuid.UUID | None` in `log_login_failure`).

## Documentation

- [x] Briefly document the testing approach, particularly the mocking of `UserEvent.create`.

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Testing Class Methods**: Using `unittest.mock.patch` to mock class methods is an effective way to test the behavior of methods that interact with the database without actually making database calls.

2. **Fixtures for Common Test Data**: Creating fixtures for common test data (like user IDs, IP addresses, etc.) helps reduce code duplication and makes tests more maintainable.

3. **Testing with Different Parameter Values**: Testing methods with different parameter values (like `user_id=None` vs a valid UUID) is important to verify that edge cases are handled correctly.

4. **Comprehensive Model Testing**: Testing all fields of a model, including optional ones, is important to ensure the model definition is sound.
