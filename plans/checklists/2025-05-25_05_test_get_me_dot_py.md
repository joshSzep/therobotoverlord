# Testing `get_current_user_info` Endpoint

This checklist outlines the tasks needed to achieve 100% test coverage for the `get_current_user_info` endpoint in `backend/src/backend/routes/users/profile/get_me.py`. The current test coverage for this file is 89%.

## Test Setup

- [ ] Ensure a test file exists, likely `backend/tests/routes/users/profile/test_get_me.py` (or confirm existing tests cover this and can be augmented).
- [ ] Set up necessary test fixtures:
  - [ ] Fixture for an authenticated `User` object (`mock_user`) with all attributes required by `UserSchema` (id, email, display_name, is_verified, last_login, role, created_at, updated_at).

## Testing `get_current_user_info` Function

### Successful User Information Retrieval
- [ ] Test that when an authenticated user requests `/me`, their information is returned correctly.
  - [ ] Verify `HTTP_200_OK` status code is returned.
  - [ ] Verify the response body matches the `UserSchema` structure.
  - [ ] Verify all fields in the response (`id`, `email`, `display_name`, `is_verified`, `last_login`, `role`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) correctly correspond to the `mock_user`'s attributes.

## Mock Strategy

- [ ] Mock `backend.routes.users.profile.get_me.get_current_user`:
  - [ ] Ensure it's mocked to return the `mock_user` fixture when the endpoint is called by the `TestClient`.

## Test Coverage Goals

- [ ] Achieve 100% line coverage for `get_current_user_info` in `get_me.py`.
  - [ ] Identify and cover the single currently missed line of code.
- [ ] Ensure the function's single execution path is thoroughly tested, confirming all attributes are correctly passed to `UserSchema`.

## Documentation

- [ ] Briefly document the test case if it's a new test or significantly augments an existing one.

## Key Lessons Learned
