# Testing `get_current_user_info` Endpoint

This checklist outlines the tasks needed to achieve 100% test coverage for the `get_current_user_info` endpoint in `backend/src/backend/routes/users/profile/get_me.py`. The current test coverage for this file is 89%.

## Test Setup

- [x] Ensure a test file exists, likely `backend/tests/routes/users/profile/test_get_me.py` (or confirm existing tests cover this and can be augmented).
- [x] Set up necessary test fixtures:
  - [x] Fixture for an authenticated `User` object (`mock_user`) with all attributes required by `UserSchema` (id, email, display_name, is_verified, last_login, role, created_at, updated_at).

## Testing `get_current_user_info` Function

### Successful User Information Retrieval
- [x] Test that when an authenticated user requests `/me`, their information is returned correctly.
  - [x] Verify `HTTP_200_OK` status code is returned.
  - [x] Verify the response body matches the `UserSchema` structure.
  - [x] Verify all fields in the response (`id`, `email`, `display_name`, `is_verified`, `last_login`, `role`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) correctly correspond to the `mock_user`'s attributes.

## Mock Strategy

- [x] Mock `backend.routes.users.profile.get_me.get_current_user`:
  - [x] Ensure it's mocked to return the `mock_user` fixture when the endpoint is called by the `TestClient`.

## Test Coverage Goals

- [x] Achieve 100% line coverage for `get_current_user_info` in `get_me.py`.
  - [x] Identify and cover the single currently missed line of code.
- [x] Ensure the function's single execution path is thoroughly tested, confirming all attributes are correctly passed to `UserSchema`.

## Documentation

- [x] Briefly document the test case if it's a new test or significantly augments an existing one.

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **FastAPI Dependency Overrides**: When testing FastAPI endpoints with dependencies, use `app.dependency_overrides` to mock dependencies rather than patching the imported functions directly.

2. **TestClient vs AsyncClient**: Regular `TestClient` should be used with non-async test functions, while AsyncIO testing would require a different approach.

3. **Fixture Composition**: The client fixture can be composed to take other fixtures (like `mock_user`) as parameters, which helps with test isolation and makes dependencies explicit.
