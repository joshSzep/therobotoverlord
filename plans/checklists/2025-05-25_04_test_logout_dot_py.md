# Testing `logout` Endpoint

This checklist outlines the tasks needed to thoroughly test the `logout` endpoint in `backend/src/backend/routes/users/profile/logout.py`. The current test coverage for this file is 65%, and our goal is to achieve 100% coverage.

## Test Setup

- [x] Create a test file at `backend/tests/routes/users/profile/test_logout.py`
- [x] Set up necessary test fixtures:
  - [x] Fixture for an authenticated `User` object (`mock_user`).
  - [x] Fixture for a mock `Request` object (handled via patching).
  - [x] Fixture for mock `UserSession` objects (`mock_active_session`).

## Testing `logout` Function

### Successful Logout Scenarios
- [x] Test logout when user has one active session matching IP and User-Agent:
  - [x] Verify `HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT` status code is returned.
  - [x] Verify `current_user.sessions.filter` is called with correct `ip_address`, `user_agent`, and `is_active=True`.
  - [x] Verify `session.invalidate()` is called on the matching active session.
  - [x] Verify `UserEvent.log_logout` is called with `current_user.id`, IP address, and User-Agent.
- [x] Test logout when user has multiple active sessions matching IP and User-Agent:
  - [x] Verify `session.invalidate()` is called on all matching active sessions.
- [x] Test logout when user has active sessions, but none match the current IP and User-Agent:
  - [x] Verify `session.invalidate()` is NOT called.
  - [x] Verify `UserEvent.log_logout` is still called.
- [x] Test logout when user has no active sessions at all:
  - [x] Verify `session.invalidate()` is NOT called.
  - [x] Verify `UserEvent.log_logout` is still called.
- [x] Test logout when `request.client` is `None`:
  - [x] Verify `current_user.sessions.filter` is called with `ip_address=UNKNOWN_IP_ADDRESS_MARKER`.
  - [x] Verify `UserEvent.log_logout` is called with `UNKNOWN_IP_ADDRESS_MARKER` for IP address.
- [x] Test logout when `User-Agent` header is missing:
  - [x] Verify `current_user.sessions.filter` is called with `user_agent=""`.
  - [x] Verify `UserEvent.log_logout` is called with an empty string for `user_agent`.

### Behavior with Inactive Sessions
- [x] Test logout when user only has inactive sessions matching IP and User-Agent:
  - [x] Verify `session.invalidate()` is NOT called (as filter includes `is_active=True`) - covered by empty results test.

## Mock Strategy

- [x] Create mocks for the following:
  - [x] `backend.routes.users.profile.logout.get_current_user` (to return the `mock_user`).
  - [x] `mock_user.sessions.filter().all()`: Created an `AsyncMock` that returns a list of mock session objects based on the test scenario.
  - [x] `mock_session.invalidate()`: Created an `AsyncMock` on the mock session objects.
  - [x] `backend.db.models.user_event.UserEvent.log_logout` class method (as an `AsyncMock`).

## Test Coverage Goals

- [x] Achieve 100% line coverage for `logout` in `logout.py`.
- [x] Ensure all conditional branches (e.g., `if request.client else ...`) are tested.
- [x] Ensure the loop for sessions is tested (empty list, single item, multiple items).

## Documentation

- [x] Document the testing approach for the `logout` endpoint within the test file or related documentation if necessary, especially the mocking of the session filtering and invalidation.

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Mocking Chained Database Queries**: To mock `user.sessions.filter(...).all()`, we need to create a mock for the filter method that returns another mock with an all method that returns the desired results.

2. **Testing Loops and Conditionals**: It's important to test multiple scenarios (empty list, single item, multiple items) to ensure all code paths are covered, especially for loops.

3. **Verifying Multiple Mock Calls**: When testing operations on multiple objects (like invalidating multiple sessions), we need to verify that the method was called on each object.

4. **Client Information Edge Cases**: Testing scenarios where client information is missing or modified requires special handling in test setup.
