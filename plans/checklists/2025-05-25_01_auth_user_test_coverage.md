  - [x] Test IP and user agent tracking

## Login Attempt Testing

- [x] Test `db/models/login_attempt.py` recording (now at 100% coverage)

  - [x] Test returned JWT tokens

- [x] Test `routes/users/auth/register.py` endpoint (now at 100% coverage)
  - [x] Fixed test implementation challenges with mocking async database interactions
  - [x] Test successful registration
  - [x] Test registration with existing email
  - [x] Test registration with invalid password
  - [x] Test user creation in database
  - [x] Fixed issues with mock user IDs to use valid UUIDs

- [x] Test `routes/users/auth/refresh_token.py` endpoint (now at 100% coverage)
  - [x] Test successful token refresh
  - [x] Test refresh with expired token
  - [x] Test refresh with invalid token
  - [x] Test refresh with malformed token
  - [x] Test token rotation security

## Profile Management Testing

- [x] Test `routes/users/profile/get_me.py` endpoint (now at 100% coverage)
  - [x] Test retrieving authenticated user profile
  - [x] Test with missing authorization
  - [x] Test with invalid token
  - [x] Test with non-existent user

- [x] Test `routes/users/profile/change_password.py` endpoint (now at 100% coverage)
  - [x] Test successful password change
  - [x] Test with incorrect current password
  - [x] Test with invalid new password
  - [x] Test with unauthorized user

- [x] Test `routes/users/profile/logout.py` endpoint (now at 100% coverage)
  - [x] Test successful logout
  - [x] Test logout with invalid session
  - [x] Test logout with expired session
  - [x] Test with unauthorized user

## Session Management Testing

- [x] Test `tasks/session.py` background tasks (now at 100% coverage)
  - [x] Test expired session cleanup
  - [x] Test session validation
  - [x] Test session management with active users
  - [x] Test edge cases for session management

## Integration Testing

- [x] Implement end-to-end authentication flow tests
  - [x] Test register → login → access protected route → logout flow
  - [x] Test login → token refresh → access protected route flow
  - [x] Test login → change password → login with new password flow

## Overall Test Coverage Progress

- [x] Increase overall authentication and user management test coverage above 90% (now at 100%)
- [x] Fix failing tests and prevent test suite from hanging
- [x] Established patterns for testing async endpoints and utilities

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **Event Loop Management**:
   - Added a proper session-scoped event loop fixture
   - Implemented thread-safe cleanup with a timeout mechanism
   - Protected against event loop closure errors

2. **Async Mocking Issues**:
   - Fixed the mock of the `secrets` module by targeting the correct import path
   - Fixed async mocking by using `mock.AsyncMock()` with the `new=` parameter instead of `autospec=True`
   - Properly mocked the `User` class methods for correct async behavior

3. **Data Validation Issues**:
   - Updated mock user IDs to use valid UUID strings instead of simple strings

## Documentation

- [x] Update documentation to reflect test coverage improvements
- [x] Document test strategies for future reference
