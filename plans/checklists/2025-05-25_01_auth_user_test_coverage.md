# Authentication and User Management Test Coverage Improvement

This checklist outlines the tasks needed to improve test coverage for the authentication and user management components of The Robot Overlord platform. Based on the coverage analysis from May 25, 2025, these components have significant gaps in test coverage that need to be addressed.

## Test Infrastructure Setup

- [ ] Implement mock database utility functions for auth testing
- [ ] Set up test environment variables for JWT secrets
- [ ] Create helper functions for generating test tokens

## Authentication Utilities Testing

- [ ] Test `utils/auth.py` JWT token creation (currently at 31% coverage)
  - [ ] Test `create_access_token` with various payloads and expiration times
  - [ ] Test `verify_token` with valid tokens
  - [ ] Test `verify_token` with expired tokens
  - [ ] Test `verify_token` with invalid signatures
  - [ ] Test `verify_token` with malformed tokens
  - [ ] Test `create_refresh_token` functionality
  - [ ] Test token rotation security features

## Password Management Testing

- [ ] Test `utils/password.py` password handling (currently at 19% coverage)
  - [ ] Test password hashing with various inputs
  - [ ] Test password verification with correct passwords
  - [ ] Test password verification with incorrect passwords
  - [ ] Test password complexity validation
  - [ ] Test minimum length validation
  - [ ] Test edge cases (empty passwords, extremely long passwords)

## User Model Testing

- [ ] Test `db/models/user.py` model methods (currently at 51% coverage)
  - [ ] Test user creation with valid data
  - [ ] Test user creation with invalid data
  - [ ] Test `set_password` method
  - [ ] Test `verify_password` method
  - [ ] Test relationship with `UserSession`
  - [ ] Test relationship with `LoginAttempt`
  - [ ] Test user retrieval by email
  - [ ] Test password update functionality

## User Session Testing

- [ ] Test `db/models/user_session.py` functionality (currently at 76% coverage)
  - [ ] Test session creation
  - [ ] Test session token validation
  - [ ] Test session expiration
  - [ ] Test relationship with User model

## Login Attempt Testing

- [ ] Test `db/models/login_attempt.py` recording (currently at 100% coverage)
  - [ ] Validate the existing test cases ensure comprehensive coverage
  - [ ] Add tests for edge cases if needed

## Authentication Routes Testing

- [ ] Test `routes/users/auth/login.py` endpoint (currently at 42% coverage)
  - [ ] Test successful login flow
  - [ ] Test login with incorrect password
  - [ ] Test login with non-existent user
  - [ ] Test login rate limiting
  - [ ] Test session creation on successful login
  - [ ] Test returned JWT tokens

- [ ] Test `routes/users/auth/register.py` endpoint (currently at 45% coverage)
  - [ ] Test successful registration
  - [ ] Test registration with existing email
  - [ ] Test registration with invalid email format
  - [ ] Test registration with invalid password
  - [ ] Test user creation in database

- [ ] Test `routes/users/auth/refresh_token.py` endpoint (currently at 38% coverage)
  - [ ] Test successful token refresh
  - [ ] Test refresh with expired token
  - [ ] Test refresh with invalid token
  - [ ] Test refresh with malformed token
  - [ ] Test token rotation security

## Profile Management Testing

- [ ] Test `routes/users/profile/change_password.py` endpoint (currently at 58% coverage)
  - [ ] Test successful password change
  - [ ] Test with incorrect current password
  - [ ] Test with invalid new password
  - [ ] Test password update in database

- [ ] Test `routes/users/profile/logout.py` endpoint (currently at 65% coverage)
  - [ ] Test successful logout
  - [ ] Test session invalidation
  - [ ] Test with invalid session
  - [ ] Test with expired session

- [ ] Test `routes/users/profile/get_me.py` endpoint (currently at 89% coverage)
  - [ ] Validate the existing test cases ensure comprehensive coverage
  - [ ] Add tests for edge cases if needed

## Session Management Testing

- [ ] Test `tasks/session.py` background tasks (currently at 38% coverage)
  - [ ] Test expired session cleanup
  - [ ] Test session validation
  - [ ] Test session management with active users
  - [ ] Test edge cases for session management

## Integration Testing

- [ ] Implement end-to-end authentication flow tests
  - [ ] Test register → login → access protected route → logout flow
  - [ ] Test login → token refresh → access protected route flow
  - [ ] Test login → change password → login with new password flow

## Documentation

- [ ] Update documentation to reflect test coverage improvements
- [ ] Document test strategies for future reference
