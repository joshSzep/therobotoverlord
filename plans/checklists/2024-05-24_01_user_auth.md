# User Authentication System Implementation Checklist

This checklist outlines the implementation steps for a complete JWT-based authentication system for The Robot Overlord platform. It covers database setup, user model creation, secure password management, token-based authentication, and session tracking. The goal is to provide secure user registration, login/logout functionality, and protected route access while maintaining proper security practices.

## Database and ORM Setup

- [ ] Install PostgreSQL and required Python packages
- [ ] Add TortoiseORM to project dependencies in pyproject.toml
- [ ] Configure database connection string in environment variables
- [ ] Set up database initialization in the application startup
- [ ] Add Aerich to project dependencies for migrations
- [ ] Configure Aerich in pyproject.toml
- [ ] Initialize Aerich for the project

## Database Models

- [ ] Create `BaseModel` with common fields (id, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at)
- [ ] Implement `User` model with required fields (email, password_hash, display_name, etc.)
- [ ] Implement `UserSession` model for tracking active sessions
- [ ] Implement `LoginAttempt` model for security monitoring
- [ ] Add model relationships and constraints
- [ ] Create Pydantic schemas for all models
- [ ] Generate initial Aerich migration
- [ ] Apply migration to create tables

## Password Management

- [ ] Implement password hashing using bcrypt
- [ ] Create password validation function (minimum length, complexity)
- [ ] Add `set_password` method to User model
- [ ] Add `verify_password` method to User model

## JWT Authentication

- [ ] Create auth utility module with JWT functions
- [ ] Implement `create_access_token` function
- [ ] Implement `verify_token` function
- [ ] Implement `create_refresh_token` function
- [ ] Implement refresh token verification and rotation
- [ ] Configure JWT secret key in environment variables
- [ ] Set appropriate token expiration times (access and refresh)

## Authentication Endpoints

- [ ] Create `/register` endpoint for user registration
- [ ] Create `/token` endpoint for user login (returns access and refresh tokens)
- [ ] Create `/refresh` endpoint for token renewal
- [ ] Create `/logout` endpoint for ending sessions
- [ ] Create `/me` endpoint for retrieving current user data
- [ ] Create `/change-password` endpoint

## Security Features

- [ ] Implement rate limiting for login attempts
- [ ] Add account lockout after multiple failed attempts (requiring admin intervention)
- [ ] Add IP and user agent tracking

## Authentication Middleware

- [ ] Create `OAuth2PasswordBearer` scheme
- [ ] Implement `get_current_user` dependency
- [ ] Add error handling for invalid/expired tokens
- [ ] Create optional dependency for getting current user (allows anonymous access)

## Session Management

- [ ] Implement session creation on login
- [ ] Add session invalidation on logout
- [ ] Create session cleanup for expired sessions
- [ ] Add support for multiple active sessions per user

## Event Logging

- [ ] Implement `UserEvent` model for tracking authentication events
- [ ] Add event logging for successful logins
- [ ] Add event logging for failed login attempts
- [ ] Add event logging for logouts
- [ ] Add event logging for password changes
- [ ] Add event logging for account lockouts

## Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for password hashing/verification
- [ ] Write unit tests for token creation/verification
- [ ] Write integration tests for registration flow
- [ ] Write integration tests for login flow
- [ ] Write integration tests for protected endpoints
- [ ] Test rate limiting and security features

## Frontend Integration

- [ ] Create login form component
- [ ] Create registration form component
- [ ] Implement client-side token storage
- [ ] Add token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Create authentication context provider
- [ ] Implement protected route components

## Documentation

- [ ] Document authentication flow
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Document security considerations and best practices
