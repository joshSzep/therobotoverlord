# User Authentication System Implementation Checklist

This checklist outlines the implementation steps for a complete JWT-based authentication system for The Robot Overlord platform. It covers database setup, user model creation, secure password management, token-based authentication, and session tracking. The goal is to provide secure user registration, login/logout functionality, and protected route access while maintaining proper security practices.

## Database and ORM Setup

- [x] Install PostgreSQL and required Python packages
- [x] Add TortoiseORM to project dependencies in pyproject.toml
- [x] Configure database connection string in environment variables
- [x] Set up database initialization in the application startup
- [x] Add Aerich to project dependencies for migrations
- [x] Configure Aerich in pyproject.toml
- [x] Initialize Aerich for the project

## Database Models

- [x] Create `BaseModel` with common fields (id, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at)
- [x] Implement `User` model with required fields (email, password_hash, display_name, etc.)
- [x] Implement `UserSession` model for tracking active sessions
- [x] Implement `LoginAttempt` model for security monitoring
- [x] Add model relationships and constraints
- [x] Create Pydantic schemas for all models
- [x] Generate initial Aerich migration
- [x] Apply migration to create tables

## Code Structure Refactoring

- [x] Refactor models to follow the targeted structure in code_structure.md
- [x] Move database models to db/models/ directory
- [x] Move Pydantic schemas to routes/users/schemas.py
- [x] Move database configuration to db/config.py
- [x] Update all import statements to reflect the new structure
- [x] Clean up any remaining files in the old models directory

## Password Management

- [x] Implement password hashing using bcrypt
- [x] Create password validation function (minimum length, complexity)
- [x] Add `set_password` method to User model
- [x] Add `verify_password` method to User model

## JWT Authentication

- [x] Create auth utility module with JWT functions
- [x] Implement `create_access_token` function
- [x] Implement `verify_token` function
- [x] Implement `create_refresh_token` function
- [x] Implement refresh token verification and rotation
- [x] Configure JWT secret key in environment variables
- [x] Set appropriate token expiration times (access and refresh)

## Authentication Endpoints

- [x] Create `/register` endpoint for user registration
- [x] Create `/token` endpoint for user login (returns access and refresh tokens)
- [x] Create `/refresh` endpoint for token renewal
- [x] Create `/logout` endpoint for ending sessions
- [x] Create `/me` endpoint for retrieving current user data
- [x] Create `/change-password` endpoint

## Security Features

- [x] Add account lockout after multiple failed attempts (requiring admin intervention)
- [x] Add IP and user agent tracking

## Authentication Middleware

- [x] Create `OAuth2PasswordBearer` scheme
- [x] Implement `get_current_user` dependency
- [x] Add error handling for invalid/expired tokens
- [x] Create optional dependency for getting current user (allows anonymous access)

## Session Management

- [x] Implement session creation on login
- [x] Add session invalidation on logout
- [x] Create session cleanup for expired sessions
- [x] Add support for multiple active sessions per user

## Event Logging

- [x] Implement `UserEvent` model for tracking authentication events
- [x] Add event logging for successful logins
- [x] Add event logging for failed login attempts
- [x] Add event logging for logouts
- [x] Add event logging for password changes
- [x] Add event logging for account lockouts

## Testing

### Manual Testing

- [x] Test user registration endpoint
- [x] Test user login endpoint
- [x] Test protected profile endpoint
- [x] Test logout endpoint
- [x] Fix session token generation issue

### Automated Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for password hashing/verification
- [ ] Write unit tests for token creation/verification
- [ ] Write integration tests for registration flow
- [ ] Write integration tests for login flow
- [ ] Write integration tests for protected endpoints
- [ ] Test security features

## Documentation

- [x] Document authentication flow
- [x] Document API endpoints
- [x] Document security considerations and best practices
