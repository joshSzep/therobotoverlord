# The Speedrun Manifesto

This repo became public at 3:30 AM because I am running my life like a speedrun.

Not for clout. Not for clicks.

For 100% Completionâ€”fulfillment, impact, legacy.

Every hour is a split. Every project is a quest. This one? It's called The Robot Overlord. It started as a thought experiment about AI judgment, and now it's real.

This document will evolve. The run continues.
